Conversion of data into a cloud-native data format
The resultant NetCDF files can be converted into a cloud-native data format so that they can be made available through a STAC (SpatioTemporal Asset Catalogs) catalog in an efficient manner. Furthermore, they need to be georeferenced so that they can be searched and accessed by using spatiotemporal queries supported by the STAC specification
