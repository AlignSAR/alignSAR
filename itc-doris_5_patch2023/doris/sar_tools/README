### Compilation:
Compile with the Makefile.
1. Typing: make install
   should compile all .c files and install them in
   the INSTALLDIRDEF (/usr/local/bin)
2. Add the install dir to your path.


### Known problems:
sometimes an include file may be different on systems.
Simply add the required file, e.g., add:
#include <cstring>
if compilation breaks down due to missing declaration of strcmp.
