Dear reader,

This directory contains some scripting utitities to be used in conjunction 
with the doris software.  Most are explained in the manual, and
also see the synopsis below.  These programs have been written by me.

-----------------------------------------------------
ascii2ascii_UTM  : Convert a 3 column ascii table from WGS lon/lat/hei
                   to UTM {X,Y,hei} triplets.  This script is an example
		   how the proj software can be used, but it can be used
		   as is as well as input in GMT.
ascii2ps         : Convert a 3 column ascii table to a postscript file.
                   GMT is used to do this.  The main output besides the plot
		   is the interpolation to a regular grid.  See the GMT
		   programs xyz2grd and surface.  This script is intented
		   as an example to be adapted to your needs.
baseline.doris   : Old?  probably to run doris from the prompt and obtain
                   the perpendicular baseline based on the orbits.
coregpm.doris    : Old.  script to iteratively run doris until the coregistration
                   parameters have been computed with good fit.  Use the card
		   CPM_MAXITER instead.
cpx2ps           : Call GMT to convert a complex file, like an interferogram
                   to a postscript plot.  I rather use cpxfiddle nowadays.
helpdoris        : man page like formatter with all options to doris.
lonlathei2ascii  : Convert binary doris output to a 3 column ascii file.
phasefilt.doris  : Script to filter an interferogram from the prompt,
                   creating dummy calls to doris.
plotcpm          : Script used in doris to plot the result of the coregistration
                   polynomial modeling.
plotoffsets      : Script used in doris to plot the result of the FINE step.
run              : General script to run doris with.
viewanddel       : General script to view temporary created postscripts.
