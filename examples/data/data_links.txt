1. Seven Sentinel-1 SAR SLC raw sample data can be downloaded through ASF (https://search.asf.alaska.edu/#/) using the Python script:
https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/ap7vIj5fPFd0TgH
(An account must be registered for ASF in advance)

2. The corresponding orbital data for Sentinel-1 SAR data can be obtained via
https://step.esa.int/auxdata/orbits/Sentinel-1/POEORB/
(The precise orbital data may be ~20 days later than the Sentinel SAR acquisition date)

3. For the use case in the Netherlands, the area of interest shapefile can be found via
https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/aeVYKto02DiQabT
This shapefile can be used when running InSAR preprocessing with DORIS-5 software and reproducing the samples of the SAR benchmark datasets.

4. The geospatial data TOP10NL data 'top10nl_Compleet-2022.gpkg' (version 2022) can be downloaded via
https://service.pdok.nl/brt/topnl/atom/top10nl.xml

5. The samples of the resultant SAR benchmark datasets for the use case in the Netherlands can be downloaded via
https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/56JthYWrVaa4ZAt
They can be processed by the scripts in the folder 'jupyter_notebook_demo'

Regarding the machine learning testing with ANN (artificial neural network), the sample data for the Netherlands use case can be downloaded via https://surfdrive.surf.nl/files/index.php/s/Crwbyo9qgYs46Si
