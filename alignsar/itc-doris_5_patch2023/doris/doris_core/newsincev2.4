Added output modelling theta to ref. ellipsoid.
Added output modelling range to ref. ellipsoid.
Changed use of real4 -> real8 matrices coreg. estimates.
Warning summary added

26-mar-2001
bugfix: processing structure after range filtering:
Processing order should be either
i)  filter based on orbits -> resample -> interf; or
ii) resample -> filter based on fr.freq. -> interf;
The bug was that when filtering based on orbits was requested,
the input for the interferogram generation was the filtered image,
NOT the resampled one. thanks to Rens Swart.


#%// BK 19-Apr-2001
changed install_doris.csh -> configure
and included test for endianness.


#%// BK 20-Apr-2001

checked code, documentation step COMPREFDEM

#%// BK 16-Apr-2002
bug report from Bruno: nextpow2 function was wrong.  (not used in Doris)
#%// BK 26-Oct-2002
bug report Raffaele: spectrum strange with shift aziumth spectrum 
resampling.  changed it to shift kernel in azimuth.
#%// BK 01-Nov-2002
Added snaphu method system call for unwrapping.
changed source code filenames to .cc instead of .c for clarity.
changed source code system include filenames for new compiler gcc3.2 (?):
iostream.h  ---> iostream
strstream.h ---> strstream
fstream.h   ---> fstream
iomanip.h   ---> iomanip
time.h      ---> ctime
string.h    ---> cstring
stdio.h     ---> cstdio
stdlib.h    ---> cstdlib
ctype.h     ---> cctype

#%// BK 03-Apr-2003
1) For new compiler, it seems ios::nocreate and ios::noreplace are not supported.
Therefore, this has been removed from the code.  Mainly used to check if files
were opened OK, and to prevent files from being overwritten (OVERWRITE OFF)
It seems the new version handles nocreate correctly, i.e., it does not
create an input file if it does not exist.
2) strandard namespace used
3) assert renamed to bk_assert, since it gave problems as a known function.
4) floor(int/int) is considered illegal, so i removed that, since int division
is already a floor.  (but less readable in my opinion)


#%// BK 08-Apr-2003
added define __NO_IOS_BINARY__ for SGI old compiler
not very nice code, probably change this one day to a define IOSBIN "| ios::binary"
so it can be easily replaced in file open constructions.

#%// BK 11-Apr-2003
Added a new class for messages, since new compiler seems to have some
problem with static old global definition.  see bk_messages.h
Added a new level: "TRACE"


#%// BK 13-Apr-2003
SARtools added cpxfiddle option for real files
added preview for unwrapped ifg hgt and real4 format
added preview for slant2h real4 format
added extensive debugging options for matrixclass/general tracing
fixed bug in matrixclass allocated bytes tracing with static totalallocated
added debug option in configure script

#%// BK 16-Jun-2003
Added envisat processing capability.
step READFILES with card method=ASAR now performs a system call
to program envisat_dump_header2doris.csh that relies on
envisat_dump_header.c program i wrote.
The only input file for this method is the asar IMS file, use
card M_IN_DAT to specify filename.
step CROP recognizes it was ASAR automatically.
Improved azimuth filter: percentage counter and output format description.
small bugfix if RS_DBOW and format CI2, and required to write
zero lines at start.
Added orbit interpolation/approximation with polynomial (LS) fit.


----release v3.6-------------------------------------------------------
bugfix: plotoffsets: line counting in awk somehow disappeared.
#%// BK 09-Jul-2003
bugfix: readinput.cc::checkcomprefdem: added check for big endian short 
format after report of Daniel.

#%// BK 14-Aug-2003
fixed cpxfiddle a bit after report flip in X for r4 data
added JERS format as input method.  i think it is ceos?
the method thus simply thus the exact same as for ERS, for read_files and crop steps
slcimage.cc recognizes ERS, ASAR, RSAT, JERS as substrings in product type specifier.

added check in coherence if master or slave amplitude  > 0.0

automated coregistration.  remove outlier windows if wtests is rejected, until
done or max_iter is reached.
#%// BK 28-Aug-2003

run script added -s9 -e9 quicklook processing.  unfortunately, step1 will crash due
to cdrom name in batch, but user will understand.
#%// BK 12-Sep-2003
cpxfiddle: skip header bytes and added more real input formats.
doris: added format checks somewhere.
doris: GPL release prepared by adding copyright notice to each file.
#%// BK 17-Oct-2003
added ./ to path for preview generation to prevent errors if "." is not in
path of inexperienced user and preview scritp cannot be executed without it.
Note that this si a unix separator.
Also, changed in coregistration.cc the automated selection of outlier window
to be the sq.sum of the wtests.
#%// BK 21-Oct-2003
Added check for RBW, RSR if they are ginven in MHZ in leaderfile for
atlantis processed data.
#%// BK 28-Oct-2003
Added some checks for configure to use strptime function
Added debug info for getorb strptime function.
#%// BK 21-Nov-2003
Added example programs for envisat alternating pol. data extraction.  Z.Perski tested this.
One program with input handling may have been nicer, but I don;t know the format well
enough to do this, and lack of time.  But they work.
#%// BK 24-Nov-2003
added check in ioroutines for strptime and endianness on the fly.
they still need to be defined via the configure script.
#%// BK 28-Nov-2003
bug report Mark Warren: outer product definition (was not used in doris)
new input card CROP_GEO with geograph. lat/lon cropping.
#%// BK 15-Dec-2003
bugfix coregistration automated outlier detection.
tested doris with JERS, seems to work. see www. only bandwidths 
could not be found in CEOS product, and orbit is terrible.
Added logging of leader file by B.Cassee for calibration purposes.
(incidence angle of first pix.  in next version this may be written
to resultfile and used as parameter)
// BK 16-Dec-2003
added knab interpolator kernels for bandlimited signal interpolation
see ieee 41 (5) pp1105-1110 Migliaccio
RS_METHOD KNAB4P
          KNAB6P
          KNAB8P
          KNAB10P
          KNAB16P
// BK 22-Dec-2003
Raffaele Nutricato offered his oversampling routines.
Doris now can perform an extra step oversampling (in range only for now)
// BK 20-Jan-2004

Added HEIGHT card for average terrain height used in crop geo.
Bugfix envisat tools, several improvements with them for CROP data.
Have to add still range_timing_error, azimuth_timing_error one day.
INCREASE/DECREASE problem signalled, not fixed.
UNWRAP TIEPOINT card for integration constant.
#%// Bert Kampes, 13-May-2004

Introduced range timing error and azimuth timing error general cards.
M_RG_T_ERROR t [s]
M_AZ_T_ERROR t [s]
S_RG_T_ERROR t [s]
S_AZ_T_ERROR t [s]
In future, we may want to set the generalinput.rg_t_error to a 
value based on e.g., processor version, PAF, etc.
We can then do this in step1routines, changing this variable, and not
via user input.
#%// Bert Kampes, 27-May-2004

Method RADARSAT for readfiles step implemented:
Added radarsat support: reading leader/volume file in CEOS,
reading info in dat file for timing.  Still unclear is how to 
convert the orbit state vectors from inertial to earth centered
earth fixed, and also how to interpolate the orbit with doris, ie., 
they are given as an arc of 15*8 minutes, which is much too long
for interpolation with say a polynomial.  This is ignored for now.
Also implemented is the cropping routine for the datafile.  All this
must be tested however, ie. regarding the DECREASE time indicator.
It should be the case that when readfiles is run, the product identifier
signifies that it is radarsat, and then automatically in the cropping
step this is recognized and used.
#%// Bert Kampes, 04-Aug-2004

matrixspecs.cc: added DEBUGMAT2 around FFTW execute plan statement to prevent lots
of output, e.g., in rangefilt.  seems that was forgotten.
ioroutines.cc: changed ctime argument to a time_t type, see man ctime.
#%// Bert Kampes, 03-Sep-2004

bugfix coherence2 routine, check zero division to avoid NaN in coherence image
bugfix goldstein routine: seemed kernel was not placed correctly
update adaptive range filter: use last know shift of spectra if a clear
 peak cannot be detected
fleefix adaptive range filter: verbose output reduced if not in debug mode
update compcoherence: strange zero starting lines removed.
 i am sure I placed it there to fix some other situation, but the 
 code as it was did not create the correct size image if the coherence
 window was larger than the multilook window.
added a function openfstream to have a singel function handling
 opening in/out binary files to avoid duplicate code.
#%// Bert Kampes, 13-Sep-2004

updated viewanddel script to use gv first. On cygwin this works fine now.
#%// Bert Kampes, 20-Sep-2004
fixed small bug in configure if byte order was incorrectly detected
reported by Mladen Zivcic
#%// Bert Kampes, 23-Jan-2005
Fixed bug in fDC computation cubic term for shifting kernel when interpolation.
new function: real8 fDC=pix2fdc(pixel,image);
#%// Bert Kampes, 02-Mar-2005
.Added conversion functions like line2ta to slcimage.h class members
because this is more logical.  Should still change it to private 
members with access over public functions.  Also, the products class
or orbit class should have a function that computes Bperp, etc.
because then it would be easy to change things like using a polynomial
for modeling, or baseline improvement based on residual fringes.
.changed names of include files from .h to .hh (c++ standard)
#%// Bert Kampes, 05-Mar-2005
added a try block to catch math errors in processor.cc
started class BASELINE in bk_baseline.hh to avoid multiple implementation
of same functionality and improve speed in future by modeling the 
baseline, etc.  This could also lead to easier correction of residual 
reference phase due to bad orbit data.
#%// Bert Kampes, 31-Mar-2005
checked Atlantis processed data read correctly
added constructor to slcimage class
added trilinear interpolation to be used with comprefdem
added is_initialized() for orbits
changed try.catch memory allocation to be default also for GNU compiler.
#%// Bert Kampes, 08-Apr-2005
debugged trilinear new COMPREFDEM, using extradense = 0.25, ca 44 MB for 1000x1000;
reasonably fast.
#%// Bert Kampes, 08-Apr-2005
added fasttrig.cc fasttrig.hh to be used in matrix class etc. for 
complex mulitplication.  to be tested gain in speed of time, acc. is <0.1degree
added key SAR_PROCESSOR ATLANTIS | VMP | TUD
written in readvolume(); read by fill_slc_image(); used in crop()
#%// Bert Kampes, 13-Apr-2005
added CRD_OUT_DEM_LP card to dump external DEM height in meters
in radar coordinates.  Request of Zbigniew Perski, goal is to
geocode these heights again, so lat/lon of a displacement interferogram
is obtained.  Option needs to be documented still by someone.
#%// Bert Kampes, 16-Apr-2005
Changed exceptions.cc to be more precise about the signal caught
Improved filtazi to check if constant Doppler can be assumed for the image.
#%// Bert Kampes, 20-Apr-2005
removed warnings from snaphu coherence window size, should be ok.
#%// Bert Kampes, 22-Apr-2005
added heightamb utility to bin dir
added raised cosine interpolation kernel for interpolation.
(new argument "RC_6" and "RC_12" for card RS_KERNEL)
see paper cho05; needs to be tested better, but is now default method in run script;
added DEBUG output of kernel.  Normalized kernel for resampling.
added [deg] for check for stepsize of DEM to be more verbose.
removed function updateslcimageML and integrated reading oversampling factor
for slc in the default function updateslcimage;
getoffset: changed to use the average of the most coherent windows in COARSE CORR;
#%// Bert Kampes, 28-Jul-2005
added azimuth oversampling method.
#%// Bert Kampes, 01-Aug-2005
added kernel az and rg for resampling.  since e.g., rc kernel has oversampling
ratio, which can be different for az and rg.  Moreover, it would be faster
to have the lookup table in range, since that does not change.
-ovs step: normalized kernel in range (sinc);  i think it would be better
to use a 6 point rc kernel in range too, but I left the original code.
#%// Bert Kampes, 12-Aug-2005
-added method for fine coreg "OVERSAMPLE" that first oversamples
the complex data by a factor two before cross-correlating the magnitude patches.
-in fine coreg first performed a local peak search, then oversample locally;
this allows to handle images with different prf etc. in principle.
-speed improvement using new routine crosscorrelate.  this routine
uses ffts smartly to get correlation for shifted matrices.
#%// Bert Kampes, 13-Aug-2005
changed name of file "step1routines" to readdata.cc
#%// Bert Kampes, 19-Aug-2005
Added a delete after new matrix in resample routine;  this may be incorrect.
#%// Bert Kampes, 24-Aug-2005
Added WIN32 define so Doris compiles under windows.  I do not support compilation
problems.  And do not advice Doris to be run under windows (gmt, getorb, snaphu, etc.
interfaces).  However, people seem to want this, and there are only a few defines.
-DWIN32
In processor.cc there also is -DWINDOWS and in the .hh files
there is a check for -DMSC_VER > 1000  I dont know why.
#%// Bert Kampes, 24-Aug-2005
Added #define spotrf spotrf_ in matrixspecs.hh ie., from now on the fortran
version of the lapack lib is used by default (most users seem to use this).
#%// Bert Kampes, 24-Aug-2005
normalized BASELINE class polynomial computation after report of some
strange error.  I cannot explain the report, but it definitely is more stable now.
#%// Bert Kampes, 25-Aug-2005
Bugfix interp_trilinear: type-->incorrect formula used (comprefdem outliers)!
#%// Bert Kampes, 25-Aug-2005
Added range time error for ERS as -1.9325e-7 sec to two-way time based
on radarcoding of precise corner reflector positions using TIEPOINT card.
#%// Bert Kampes, 20-Sep-2005
added fast_sin(); fast_cos(); fast_atan(); fast_atan2(); fast_arg() using
look-up tables also for matrix class + fast_angle(); fast_angle2cmplx;
fast_dotmultconjphase().  fast_min_sin();
these functions are used in products.cc for complex subtraction of ref.phase, etc.
and in coregistration::resample() for kernel spectrum centering around fdc.
error max. 1/1000 or max 0.003 rad for angles.
it seems LUT is factor 5 to 20 faster for fast machines than std::sin()
#%// Bert Kampes, 04-Oct-2005
change size of lut of coregistration to power of two 128, could be more
memory suitable (from 101).
#%// Bert Kampes, 04-Oct-2005
removed refsystems.hh conversion.hh conversion.cc and put some routines
in ellips class, others in utilities.
#%// Bert Kampes, 05-Oct-2005
improved geocoding, for large heights there likely was an 
offset in lat/lon geocoded coordinates.
#%// Bert Kampes, 06-Oct-2005
added pointer for faster operator *, matTxmat, matxmatT in matrix class
added transpose to matrix class
added tests for these functions in matrixbk_test.cc
still unclear why in class some are friends, like transpose, sqrt, some are not;
i think sqrt and transpose shoudl be moved to matrixbk.cc as template
function
#%// Bert Kampes, 13-Oct-2005
tested new template<> template<class> for g++-4.0 compilers.
the code now compiles using this compiler.  Use -O max. optimization.
#%// Bert Kampes, 13-Oct-2005
----released v3.17-------------------------------------------------------

New features:

1) Handling of file sizes larger than 4GB on both 32-bit and 64-bit
   platforms.
2) Processing for TerraSAR-X data. See Appendix B.1.4 for installation
guidelines.
3) Improvement of the master-slave overlap calculation. The new
   algorithm should prevent segmentation faults as sometimes
   experienced in the past.
4) Improvement and speed-up of COMPREFDEM based on a two-step
   approach. First, the complete DEM is radarcoded and written to a
   file. Second, the radarcoded DEM is interpolated to the master image
   geometry using Delaunay triangulation. The overlapping buffers, as in
   previous versions of Doris, are prevented.
5) Simulation of master amplitude image based on DEM (M_SIMAMP).
6) Estimation of master timing error based on correlation between
   master amplitude and simulated master amplitude (M_TIMING).
7) Estimation of relative timing error between master and slave image
   (RELTIMING).
8) DEM assisted coregistration (DEMASSIST). For optimal performance,
   apply after M_SIMAMP, M_TIMING and RELTIMING.
9) Coherence estimation after DEM subtraction (default).
10) Utility construct_dem.sh to download, merge and fill voids of SRTM
   data.
11) Utility doris.process-reset.sh to reset and clean up the
   processing entries in Doris result files allowing to easily re-run a
   step or multiple steps.
12) Option to output height-to-phase conversion factors (H2PH) based
   on flat earth (SUBTRREFPHA) or DEM (COMPREFDEM).
13) During COARSECORR and FINE coregistration NaN (not-a-number)
   correlation values, which are mainly due to no data regions at the
   border of the scene, are eliminated automatically, but the whole list
   of windows are kept in the doris.log file.
14) Coherence output is properly scaled between 0 to 1 range with new
   option -r of cpxfiddle.
