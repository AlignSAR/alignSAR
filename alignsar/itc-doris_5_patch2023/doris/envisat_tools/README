Here we have 4 c programs to handle ENVISAT data.
-------------------------------------------------
envisat_dump_header simply reads in the header and dumps it.
envisat_dump_header2doris.csh is a simple csh program that
                    calls envisat_dump_header and then uses
		    awk command to create a result section for
		    doris.
envisat_dump_data   creates a "raw" pixel interleaved short
                    complex file, major row order, in the 
		    host byte order.  possibly a crop.

envisat_dump_data_HH Similarly dumps HH polarization band "MDS1"
                     from alternating polarization products.
envisat_dump_data_VV Similarly dumps VV polarization band "MDS2"
                     from alternating polarization products.  

The library function from the epr_api c functions distributed
by ESA under the public domain type licence are used to access
the data.  

To compile the programs, perform a "make" and a "make install".
Make sure to specify the correct c compiler (gcc by default)
and installation directory (/usr/local/bin)

History
------

#%// TU Delft 06-Jan-2011 [MA]
Change from epr_api 2.0.1 to 2.2 for full 64-bit support
see epr_api 2.2 Change.txt for more information

#%// TU Delft 19-Oct-2010 [MA]
Tweak epr_api so it handles ERS1/2 in Envisat format

#%// BK 16-Apr-2004
It seems on some systems these programs act a bit strangely.
We took out -O3 for compilation.
Could also have to do with the script envisat2doris.csh, that some
awk is wrong there on linux and not on SUN??

#%// BK 24-Nov-2003
There are also 2 simple programs that extract HH and VV from alternating
polarization products.  These are extreme simple hacks.
They actually simply dump the records named "MDS1" and "MDS2".
